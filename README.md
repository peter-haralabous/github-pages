# Static Site

This repository has been wiped and replaced with a minimal static site to be hosted with GitHub Pages.

To publish to GitHub Pages (from `main` branch):

1. Commit and push to the `main` branch.
2. In the repository settings -> Pages, set the source to the `main` branch root.

That's it — your `index.html` will be served at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/`.
